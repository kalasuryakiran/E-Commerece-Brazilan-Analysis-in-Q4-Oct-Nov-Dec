📁 Dataset Not Included in Repository

Due to the large size of the original Olist e-commerce dataset (~50MB+ across multiple CSVs), it is not hosted directly in this GitHub repository to avoid bloating the version control system and maintain faster cloning speed.

✅ The dataset can be freely accessed and downloaded from the following official source:
